I have used the GumballMachine class and made changes in its constructor to accept two parameters, one for number of gumballs and the second one for price of each gumball.
I used the switch case to selct the type of gumball that must be considered as type 1,2 and 3 respectively.
for the type 3 machine i.e., the one which accepts nickels, dimes and quarters, I have created a child class for the GumballMachine class which would then override the insertQuarter and turnCrank methods to support the type 3 machine.
I used the reset() method to reset the multiple boolean and the total values to be reset to initial state after a gumball is ejected.
