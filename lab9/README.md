## Pattern Implemented : Factory Method

> - Convetional factory pattern  needed object creation in the returning method.<br>
> - Used a hashmap to return the constructor method for the required object. <br>
> - Using lamda patterns enabled a reference to the constructor of the required object. <br>
> - Seemed efficient to use lambda expressions for factory method.
